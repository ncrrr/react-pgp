# React PGP

This is a simple app client side only using [OpenPGP JS](https://openpgpjs.org/).
This app includes features like:

- encrypt a plain text message into a PGP block using a PGP public key (with optionnal message signing using a private PGP key and its passphrase)
- decrypt a PGP block message using a private PGP key and a passphrase (optionnal verification using a public PGP key)
- sign a plain text message using a private PGP key and a passphrase to prove message identity
- verify a signed message using a public key to check a signed message identity


To install the app, simply clone this project and run a few commands

- `npm install` or `yarn install`
and 
- `npm start` or `yarn start`

Enjoy !
